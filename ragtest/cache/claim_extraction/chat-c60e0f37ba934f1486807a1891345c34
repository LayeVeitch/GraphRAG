{"result": "I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification**\n\nThe entity specification is a list of entity types: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']. We need to extract all named entities from the text that match these types.\n\nUsing a named entity recognition (NER) tool, we can identify the following entities:\n\n* Organization: None\n* Person: Peter, Martha\n* Geo: None\n* Event: None\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the text, we notice that \"milliner's\" is an organization. So, our updated list of entities is:\n\n* Organization: milliner's\n* Person: Peter, Martha\n* Geo: None\n* Event: None\n\n**Step 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity**\n\nWe'll examine each entity and look for claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\n\nFor \"milliner's\", we don't find any specific claims. However, we do note that Martha is an apprentice at a milliner's, which might imply some connection between the organization and Martha.\n\nFor \"Peter\" and \"Martha\", we can extract the following claims:\n\n* Peter: None\n* Martha: She works as an apprentice at a milliner's, has seen a countess and a lord, and plans to lie abed tomorrow morning for a good long rest.\n\n**Step 3: For each claim, extract the required information**\n\nWe'll format each claim according to the specified requirements:\n\n1. Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized.\n2. Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized (if applicable).\n3. Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized.\n4. Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**.\n5. Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n6. Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made (if applicable).\n7. Claim Source Text: List of quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nHere are the extracted claims:\n\n1.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

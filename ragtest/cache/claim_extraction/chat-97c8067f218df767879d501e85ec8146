{"result": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help analyze claims against certain entities based on a given text document. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, the entity specification includes 'organization', 'person', 'geo', and 'event'. So I need to extract all named entities from the text that fall into these categories.\n\nLooking at the provided text, it's about Project Gutenberg and their license terms. The main entities here are \"Project Gutenberg\" which is an organization. There aren't any other organizations mentioned. As for persons, none are specified in the text. Geo-wise, the United States is mentioned, so that's a geo entity. Events? I don't see any specific events mentioned beyond the redistribution of works.\n\nNext, I need to extract claims against these entities. The claim description is about any relevant information discovery facts or claims. So I'm looking for statements that could be claims against Project Gutenberg or the United States.\n\nIn the text, it says that Project Gutenberg's work can be accessed without cost in most parts of the world but requires checking local laws outside the U.S. This implies a restriction based on location, which might be a claim about copyright limitations.\n\nSo, for \"Project Gutenberg\" as the subject, the object is \"United States\" because the restrictions are tied to that country. The claim type would relate to copyright or distribution policies. Since it's stated factually in the text, the status is TRUE. The dates aren't specified, so I'll use NONE. The description should summarize this restriction, and the source text includes the relevant quotes.\n\nI don't see any other claims against \"Project Gutenberg\" or \"United States\" beyond this point. There are no persons involved, so no claims there either. No events were mentioned that could form a claim.\n\nSo, I'll structure the output with one claim involving Project Gutenberg and the United States regarding copyright restrictions.\n</think>\n\n(ORGANIZATION<|>UNITED STATES<|>COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Project Gutenberg's work can be accessed without cost in most parts of the world, but users outside the United States must check local laws before using the eBook.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

{"result": "I'll guide you through the process of extracting claims against entities from the given text document.\n\n**Step 1: Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification**\n\nThe entity specification is a list of entity types: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']. We need to extract all entities that match these types from the text.\n\nUsing a named entity recognition (NER) tool or library, we can identify the following entities:\n\n* Organization: Fezziwig, Scrooge\n* Person: Dick, Ebenezer, Fezziwig\n* Geo: None found in this text\n* Event: Christmas\n\n**Step 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity**\n\nWe'll examine each sentence in the text to find claims related to these entities.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Sentence 1: \"There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick.\"\n\t+ Claim: Dick was attached to Scrooge.\n\t+ Subject: DICK\n\t+ Object: SCROOGE (not explicitly mentioned, but implied)\n\t+ Claim Type: PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP\n\t+ Claim Status: TRUE\n\t+ Claim Description: The text states that Dick was very much attached to Scrooge.\n\t+ Claim Date: None found in this sentence\n\t+ Claim Source Text: \"There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick.\"\n* Sentence 2: \"Yo ho, my boys!' said Fezziwig. 'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,' cried old Fezziwig...\"\n\t+ Claim: Fezziwig celebrated Christmas with Scrooge and Dick.\n\t+ Subject: FEZZIWIG\n\t+ Object: SCROOGE, DICK (implied)\n\t+ Claim Type: EVENT PARTICIPATION\n\t+ Claim Status: TRUE\n\t+ Claim Description: The text states that Fezziwig celebrated Christmas with his employees, including Scrooge and Dick.\n\t+ Claim Date: None found in this sentence\n\t+ Claim Source Text: \"Yo ho, my boys!' said Fezziwig. 'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,' cried old Fezziwig...\"\n\n**Step 3: Format each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)**\n\nUsing the extracted claims, we can format them according to the required output:\n\n(DICK<|>SCROOGE<|>PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Dick was attached to Scrooge.<|>There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick.)\n##\n(FEZZIWIG<|>SCROOGE,DICK<|>EVENT PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Fezziwig celebrated Christmas with Scrooge and Dick.<|>Yo ho, my boys!' said Fezziwig. 'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,' cried old Fezziwig...)\n\n**Step 4: Combine all claims into a single output**\n\nThe final output will be:\n\n(DICK<|>SCROOGE<|>PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Dick was attached to Scrooge.<|>There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick.)\n##\n(FEZZIWIG<|>SCROOGE,DICK<|>EVENT PARTICIPATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Fezziwig celebrated Christmas with Scrooge and Dick.<|>Yo ho, my boys!' said Fezziwig. 'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,' cried old Fezziwig...)\n\nNote that some claims may not have a clear object entity (e.g., \"Fezziwig celebrated Christmas with Scrooge and Dick.\"). In such cases, we can use a more general object entity like \"EMPLOYEES\" or \"FRIENDS.\"", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

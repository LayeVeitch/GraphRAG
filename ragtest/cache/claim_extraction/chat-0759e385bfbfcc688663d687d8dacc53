{"result": "I'll guide you through the process of extracting claims from the given text.\n\n**Step 1: Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification.**\n\nThe entity specification is a list of entity types: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']. We need to extract all entities that match these types from the text.\n\nUsing a named entity recognition (NER) tool or library, we can identify the following entities:\n\n* Organization: None\n* Person: None\n* Geo: None\n* Event: None\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the text, we find some potential matches:\n\n* \"the house\" could be considered an organization, but it's not a specific entity.\n* \"the Ghost\" is likely a person or entity, but its type is unclear.\n* There are no explicit geo entities mentioned in the text.\n\n**Step 2: For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity.**\n\nSince we didn't find any clear matches for organizations, people, or geos, we'll focus on extracting claims related to events (which is a bit of a stretch, as there are no explicit event mentions).\n\nUpon re-reading the text, we can identify some potential claims:\n\n* The Ghost exulted and floated on, outpouring its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach.\n* The very lamplighter ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light.\n\nThese claims seem to describe the Ghost's behavior and the lamplighter's actions. We can extract some information from these claims:\n\n**Claim 1:**\n\n* Subject: THE GHOST\n* Object: NONE\n* Claim Type: EVENT_DESCRIPTION\n* Claim Status: SUSPECTED (as we're not sure what kind of event this is)\n* Claim Date: NONE\n* Claim Description: The Ghost exulted and floated on, outpouring its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach.\n* Claim Source Text: \"The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light...\"\n\n**Claim 2:**\n\n* Subject: THE LAMPLIGHTER\n* Object: NONE\n* Claim Type: EVENT_DESCRIPTION\n* Claim Status: SUSPECTED (as we're not sure what kind of event this is)\n* Claim Date: NONE\n* Claim Description: The lamplighter ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light.\n* Claim Source Text: \"The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light...\"\n\n**Step 3: Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2.**\n\nHere's the output:\n\n(THE GHOST<|>NONE<|>EVENT_DESCRIPTION<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Ghost exulted and floated on, outpouring its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach.<|>The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light...)\n(THE LAMPLIGHTER<|>NONE<|>EVENT_DESCRIPTION<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The lamplighter ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light.<|>The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light...)\n\nNote that these claims are quite vague and might not be what you're looking for.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

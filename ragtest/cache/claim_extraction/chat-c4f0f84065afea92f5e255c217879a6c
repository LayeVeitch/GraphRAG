The entity specification includes 'organization', 'person', 'geo', and 'event'. The claim description is about any relevant information for discovery.\n\nLooking at the text, it's a scene from \"A Christmas Carol\" involving Scrooge, Fezziwig, Dick Wilkins, and mentions of Christmas Eve. \n\nFirst, I need to extract entities matching the specifications. Persons here are Scrooge, Fezziwig, and Dick Wilkins. The event is Christmas Eve.\n\nNext, for each entity, find claims relevant to information discovery. \n\nFor Scrooge: He's reacting emotionally upon seeing Fezziwig, which shows his past feelings. This could be a claim about emotional reactions.\n\nFezziwig: He stops work early on Christmas Eve, indicating a joyful event. That's a claim about celebrating the holiday.\n\nDick Wilkins: He's described as attached to Scrooge, showing their relationship. This is a claim about personal connections.\n\nChristmas Eve: The event itself is significant as it's when Fezziwig announces the shutdown, highlighting its importance in the narrative.\n\nEach claim needs details like subject, object, type, status, dates, description, and source text.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

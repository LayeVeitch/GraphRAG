They are not only family members who enjoy music together, but also have a close bond as friends. Specifically, it can be inferred that Scrooge's nephew has a friendship with Topper, suggesting a familial tie between the three.\n\nNote: I've resolved the potential contradiction by assuming that \"Scrooge and Topper\" refers to two individuals who are family members, rather than Scrooge being a single entity and Topper being a separate entity.
